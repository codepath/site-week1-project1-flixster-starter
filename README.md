### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics in the labs prepared me to complete the assignment. Lab 1 gave me the tools to start understanding flex-box in a website, accessibility features, css styling on a website and to incorporate website responsiveness with media queries. Also, it touched upon forking a repository and cloning it in your local computer which I was a little confused about how to do, but I am glad my instructors went over the process in class.

Lab 2, allowed me to understand how to define and manipulate variables, functions, and Objects in JavaScript which is something that I had never done so in depth. Also, it allowed me to utilize DOM methods and properties to reference elements by selectors. For this assignment, I felt prepared to utilize DOM methods, but I did not feel prepared to do the “toggle between different semesters” feature. 

Finally Lab 3, which I feel like was very crucial for this week's project, allowed me to understand and put into practice how to fetch data from an API. In this case was the Giphy website. For this lab I felt unprepared in how to properly fetch the API, but my instructors did live demos in clase on fetching a fake API which was very helpful to understand the overall concept.


- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had been given more time, there are several improvements I would have made to enhance the project further. Firstly, I would have prioritized implementing a dark/light mode feature. This would provide users with the option to switch to a darker/lighter color scheme, making it more visually comfortable, especially in low-light or high-light environments.

In addition to the dark mode button, I would have dedicated time to incorporating a language selection feature. This would have expanded the web accessibility by allowing users to choose their preferred language, accommodating a wider range of individuals and promoting inclusivity.

Furthermore, if given more time, I would have integrated an API that connects to local movie theaters. This feature would have allowed users to view the current showtimes for movies and provided a convenient way to plan their cinema visits. Alongside the showtimes, I would have included trailers for each movie, enabling users to get a preview of the films within a popup window.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the project demo, there were several aspects that went well and contributed to a positive experience. One notable highlight was the supportive and constructive feedback given by everyone in the cohort. It created a collaborative environment where we could all learn from each other's projects and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, the demos went as planned. Some peers chose to present their projects using slides, while others demonstrated their websites directly, guiding the cohort through their design and development process. Both approaches were effective in showcasing the projects and providing valuable insights.

Throughout the demos, I noticed two impressive features in my peers' projects that I would like to incorporate in my future assignments. One feature, demonstrated by Khalid, was the absence of a submit button in the search bar of his website. Instead, as soon as he started typing, the list of movies dynamically appeared, creating a seamless and interactive user experience. This feature stood out to me because it is an efficient way to enhance the search functionality.

The other feature that caught my attention was in Marwan's website. He had a moving icon incorporated into his title, adding a unique and personal touch to his project. 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I want to give a huge shout out to my cohort mentors: Paige, Sammy and Ashaun. Also, I want to thank all my cohort peers specially: Nara, Maria, Cesar, Khalid, Brian and David for helping me throughout this project.
