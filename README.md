### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed prepared me to complete the assignment. Particularly, exercises we did in class such as working with a fake API and updating the DOM using javascript were directly applicable to the project. Regarding the labs, because the Giphy lab was so similar to the project, topics discussed in it were directly applicable. However, styling with css was difficult, and the lessons did not really particularly help me with it; however, I got experience with having to look up and find resources myself.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have added animations so that when a user hovers the image looks bigger and is outlined. I also would have liked to allow the user to see details when they clicked on the movie poster. I also would have made it so that the close search button is only visible when something has been searched and is hidden when only the now-playing movies are displayed.
  

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I did not present my project as only five people presented today. However, from my peers, I saw transitions and animations implemented which I would like to implement next time.
