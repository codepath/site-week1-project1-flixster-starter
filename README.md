### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes they were enough to complete the assignment. Even though it was not necessary to implement all the animations and decorations, I feel that basic stuff such as transitions should have been covered in class, so I had to Google and use my documentation to make my website more visibly pretty. So more CSS basically.


- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Probably add more accesibility. Yes, I would have added probably a light and dark mode, and some other accesibility features that i consider super important.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I believe theres a lot of things that didnt go as planned, especially the load more and search buttons. When you loaded more pages while being on a search, it would not load more movies of what you searched but the normal playing now page. I noticed that my peers added animations and moving icons, and also that instead of a search and submit button they had the items load as they typed.
